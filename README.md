The main goal of the exercise is to develop a web application with Ruby on Rails in which we are going to implement a web system for managing a ToDo Web Application similar to Todoist. In order to solve the exercise is mandatory to use software development good practices, like version control software (git) and code hosting (GitHub) and is advisable to use TDD (Test Driven Development, by using RSpec).

We want to develop a ToDo Web Application, similar to Todoist in Ruby on Rails. This app should fulfil the following requirements: 
-	It should be accessible from any web browser. 
-	Application should allow the user the management (CRUD operations) of: 
o	Tasks (Create, Edit, Delete, Check). Tasks have a priority (High, Medium, Low) and they can have deadline date. 
o	Project or Tasks collections (Create, Add and Remove Tasks, Delete and Share). 
o	Users (Sign-in, Login, Logout, Delete). 
o	Tasks collections sharing (Requests, Allowance, Denial, Revoke).  
-	The app should have a User Management module, which permits users to access the system by authenticating themselves and determining user roles: 
o	Administrator: Can manage users, relationships, tasks collections and tasks 
o	User: Can create tasks and collections and can share task collections.
